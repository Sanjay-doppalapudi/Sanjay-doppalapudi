# Hi — I’m **Sanjay Doppalapudi** 👋

Ph.D. student in Computer Science | **Generative AI & LLMs** researcher and engineer | builder of full-stack & agent systems

I study emergent behaviors in large language models and build end-to-end systems to experiment with, evaluate, and productize LLM research. I like shipping reproducible demos, creating clean READMEs, and making research easy to run and reproduce.

---

## 🔭 Current work

* Building **Agent-Platform** — an experimentation / orchestration platform for multi-agent research.
* Developing **Council-of-LLM-s** — experiments for multi-agent collaboration & theory-of-mind style research.
* Improving reproducibility for LLM experiments: training, evaluation, and deployment workflows.

(See my pinned repos below for details and quick demos.)
